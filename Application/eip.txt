Yes — **Pimlico *does* support EIP-7702**, but there’s an important nuance about **which chains** that support applies to. ([docs.pimlico.io][1])

### ✅ Pimlico supports EIP-7702

According to Pimlico’s own documentation, the platform lets you include an `eip7702Auth` object in `eth_sendUserOperation` and `eth_estimateUserOperationGas` calls — meaning Pimlico’s RPC and bundler infrastructure *can handle* EIP-7702 style user operations. ([docs.pimlico.io][1])

---

### ❓ Supported chains for EIP-7702 with Pimlico

**Pimlico’s FAQ specifically lists supported chains for EIP-7702 support, and *Celo is *not* among them.**
Chains they explicitly include are:

* Ethereum Mainnet (including Sepolia)
* BNB Smart Chain
* OP-Stack chains (like Base, Optimism, Zora, etc.)
* Odyssey Testnet
  …among others listed in their docs. ([docs.pimlico.io][1])

However, *Pimlico does support Celo generally* as an RPC target — just not listed under their EIP-7702 support table. ([docs.pimlico.io][2])

---

### 🍋 What this means for Celo

Celo **itself supports EIP-7702 at the protocol level** thanks to the *Isthmus upgrade* (an upgrade that brings Prague features such as EIP-7702 into Celo). ([specs.celo.org][3])

But the fact that Pimlico doesn’t explicitly list Celo under its EIP-7702 support in their official docs implies:

* 🔹 You **can use Pimlico for standard RPC / ABI / paymaster services on Celo**
* 🔹 But Pimlico’s **EIP-7702 userOperation endpoints might *not* work out-of-the-box on Celo**
  (since they only list other chains for EIP-7702 in the FAQ) ([docs.pimlico.io][1])

---

### 🧠 So in short…

✔ **Pimlico supports EIP-7702 in general** — they let you include `eip7702Auth` in UserOps. ([docs.pimlico.io][1])
✔ **Celo at the protocol level supports EIP-7702** thanks to the Isthmus hard fork. ([specs.celo.org][3])
❌ **Pimlico does *not explicitly list Celo as supported for EIP-7702 in their docs** — meaning the EIP-7702 tooling may not yet be wired up for Celo through Pimlico. ([docs.pimlico.io][1])

---

## 📌 Recommendation

If you want to do gas-sponsored or 7702 style account abstraction on Celo today, consider:

* **thirdweb’s EIP-7702 stack**, which *explicitly supports Celo*. ([thirdweb docs][4])
* Or check with Pimlico support for current or upcoming Celo EIP-7702 coverage

---

## 🧩 TL;DR

> **Does Pimlico support EIP-7702 on Celo?**
> **Not yet officially — yes to EIP-7702 generally, but Celo isn’t explicitly supported in their EIP-7702 docs.** ([docs.pimlico.io][1])

If you want, I can show you how to test a 7702 user operation on Celo using either thirdweb or direct RPC — just ask! 🚀
